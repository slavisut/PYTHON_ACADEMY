projekt1.py = Text analyser project.
I described steps directly inside the code
I took a little liberty with 2 points from task definition:
  A. Ending the script when wrong username or password is given. -
      Instead of just 1 message I display separate ones for wrong login and pass. Its not making the task easier and looks better in my opinion
  B. Summing the number sin text - I sum not just standalone numbers, but also if part of string is number,
      for example in first text theres '30N' string. Again thi is making the task harder, and I wanted to challenge myself.
  C. Formating - I was writing parts of the code in google collab, which gives me default 2 spaces after if, elif, for etc. statements.
      As I was copying the parts into VSC, i found it really distracting to constantly chnage the spaces from 2 to 4, so I left 2 everywhere, 
      code works and to me it looks better and wors are less long in case of multiple IFs. 
      I looked around on the internet and consensus is either 4 (more often) or 2, but the most important thing is to be consistent.
      Let me know your feedback on this :)
No further deviations from the task.
